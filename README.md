# DayZMod 1.9.0 Namalsk Server
Server files to host a DayZ Mod Namalsk server. Credit to JasonTM / WorldWideSorrow for the guide it was based on.

The objective of this project is to create a solid foundation for a DayZ 1.9.0 Namalsk server complete with all Namalsk features (EVR storms, snow, warm clothing, bloodsuckers...etc).
Custom features such as missions, roaming AI, specific server branding are intentional not included to create a base template for a Namalsk server.

If you are unsure of how to setup a server using these files refer to this awesome guide by skigoggles: https://helpthedeadreturn.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/how-to-create-your-own-dayzmod-vanilla-server/

Don't forget to add the Namalsk mod to your startup.bat parameters eg. (-mod=@Namalsk;@DayZ;@DayZ_Namalsk_Server)
